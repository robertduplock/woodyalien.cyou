[{"categories":["Reviews"],"contents":"In the wild, swinging 60s, there was a glut of silly, screwball comedies released. My favourites were the very English \u0026ldquo;Carry On\u0026rdquo; movies.\nAllen\u0026rsquo;s interest in European cinema might have influenced his very first movie, What\u0026rsquo;s New Pussycat. The movie is set in France, and for no obvious reason everyone in it is American. The jokes are wild and silly, with lines like \u0026ldquo;Excuse me, I need to go the bathroom and take an overdose of sleeping pills.\u0026rdquo;\nPeter O\u0026rsquo;Toole, a huge star at the time, leads the movie as the serial womanizer Michael James. The jokes are mainly about sex, and only about 30% of them are funny. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is any kind of a storyline.\nBut all the usual Allen trademarks are there. There is a hopeless shrink, an older man who chases women, and references to art, cinema and death. Allen himself only appears in a handful of scenes.\nI could imagine Allen sitting at his typewriter, thinking to himself: \u0026ldquo;What are some funny things that could be in a movie?\u0026rdquo; Each of these ideas were awkwardly shoehorned into the screenplay.\nO\u0026rsquo;Toole lacks the kind of offbeat comic timing that Allen himself excels at, and many of his overacted (and probably semi-improvised scenes) are noisy, yelly and not very funny. Equally, Peter Sellers, donning a bizarre Joey Ramone hairpiece, really hams it up as the kooky shrink, but fails to deliver many funny lines.\nThere are some funny one-liners, but they often get lost in the noise. There is a boozy randomness to the movie that echoes the crazyiness of some of Fellini\u0026rsquo;s work. What\u0026rsquo;s New Pussycat doesn\u0026rsquo;t really feel like an Allen movie. After all, although he did write it, the movie was twisted and mangled beyond recognition by the time it hit the screens.\nWatching the movie in 2021, the retro 60s aesthetic and French connection are fun to watch. The quirky drawings in the opening credits, for example, are wonderful relics of a bygone era. The clothes are colourful, the women beautiful, the decor charming. Indeed, with a bit more thought, the movie could have been a really fun retro romp.\nThe main running gag with Allen\u0026rsquo;s character is that he is short. In one scene, his love interest coaxes him into standing up to a burly guy who takes a book that she wants. \u0026ldquo;Look at the size of his knuckles!\u0026rdquo; he says. Mostly, these scenes fall as flat as any of the others.\nA few funny one-liners aside, What\u0026rsquo;s New Pussycat is a pretty tough watch. But in many ways, the minor disaster that was this movie inspired Allen to take more creative control over his movies. And that\u0026rsquo;s something to be grateful for.\n","date":"05","image":"https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/rq8908sDqtyEGiRagGtPYuWSwFb.jpg","permalink":"https://woody-alien.cyou/blog/post-8/","tags":["Writer","Actor"],"title":"What's New Pussycat?
